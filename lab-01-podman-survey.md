# Lab 1: Docker Lab - Slack Survey

We use beyond poll in Slack to see how far the participants are. We use Public votes and multiple select as poll options.

```bash
/poll "Lab 1 Prereq - Docker Lab" "I have Docker Desktop installed" "Nope - I do not have Docker Desktop up and running"
```

```bash
/poll "Lab 1 - Docker Lab" "I have run Docker Hello World" "I did the CouchDB interactions" "I have removed the containers and images"
```

```bash
/poll "Lab 1 - Docker Lab (extended)" "I have build, tagged and run a custom nodejs image"
```

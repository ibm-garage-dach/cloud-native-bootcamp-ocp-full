# Lab 1: Using and developing Helm templates - Slack Survey

We use beyond poll in Slack to see how far the participants are. We use Public votes and multiple select as poll options.

```bash
/poll "Lab 11 : Using and developing Helm templates - Survey" "Create sample helm chart and install it onto the Openshift" "Successfully uninstall sample helm chart" "Create PersistentVolumeClaim resource definition" "Create ConfigMap" "Create Secret" "Update Deployment for Postgresql" "Install and Verify installed resources" "Uninstall your halm chart"
```

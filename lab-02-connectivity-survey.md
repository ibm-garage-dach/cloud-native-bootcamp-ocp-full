# Lab 2: IBM Cloud + OpenShift connectivity check - Slack Survey

We use beyond poll in Slack to see how far the participants are. We use Public votes and multiple select as poll options.

```bash
/poll "Lab 2 Connectivity - Survey" "Login to cloud.ibm.com works" "I can switch to the Customer Workshop Account and see the OpenShift cluster" "I can connect to the cluster from my own OC CLI setup"
```

# Lab 7: Services

## Prerequisites

**Remove the existing jedi deployment in your namespace before starting this lab.**

You can retrieve metadata from your OpenShift cluster.

```bash
$ oc get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
10.134.237.197   Ready    master,worker   52d   v1.19.0+e49167a
10.134.237.201   Ready    master,worker   52d   v1.19.0+e49167a
10.134.237.236   Ready    master,worker   52d   v1.19.0+e49167a
```

Make sure everytime you create resources that you

- target the right OpenShift cluster
- target the right OpenShift Project / Kubernetes namespace

## Challenges to be solved

We have a jedi-deployment and yoda-deployment that need to communicate with others. The jedi needs to talk to the world (outside the cluster), while yoda only needs to talk to jedi council (others in the cluster).

Examine the two deployments, and create two services that meet the following criteria.

**jedi-svc**

- The service name is jedi-svc.
- The service exposes the pod replicas managed by the deployment named jedi-deployment.
- The service listens on port 80 and its targetPort matches the port exposed by the pods.
- The service type is NodePort.

**yoda-svc**

- The service name is yoda-svc.
- The service exposes the pod replicas managed by the deployment named yoda-deployment.
- The service listens on port 80 and its targetPort matches the port exposed by the pods.
- The service type is ClusterIP.

Create those two deployments as basis for your service definitions:

**07-jedi-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jedi-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jedi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jedi
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: bitnami/nginx:1.16.1
          name: c
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

**07-yoda-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: yoda-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: yoda
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: yoda
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: bitnami/nginx:1.16.1
          name: c
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

## Verification

Validate that both Kubernetes services have been created. Both services are within a private IP address range that cannot be reached from the public internet.
Make a note though of the node port - in this example 30879, yours will be different.

```bash
$ oc get svc
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
jedi-svc   NodePort    172.21.96.12     <none>        80:30879/TCP   57s
yoda-svc   ClusterIP   172.21.235.139   <none>        80/TCP         48s
```

### Validating internet access through node port into jedi-svc

To access the jedi-svc we have to find out the public IP addresses of our worker nodes. Using `kubectl get nodes -o wide` gives us private and public ip addresses of our worker nodes. The worker nodes within IBM Cloud are attached to a public and a private VLAN. Alternatively you can also use `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster clustername`.

```bash
$ ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster iks-garage-dach
NAME             STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ID                                                       Public IP         Private IP       Flavor               State    Status   Zone    Version
kube-btnneqaf0ve384q6rsm0-iksgarageda-default-00000171   159.122.100.82    10.134.237.244   b3c.4x16.encrypted   normal   Ready    fra02   1.17.11_1539
kube-btnneqaf0ve384q6rsm0-iksgarageda-default-000002fd   159.122.100.91    10.134.237.245   b3c.4x16.encrypted   normal   Ready    fra02   1.17.11_1539
kube-btnneqaf0ve384q6rsm0-iksgarageda-default-0000033b   158.177.255.212   10.134.237.212   b3c.4x16.encrypted   normal   Ready    fra02   1.17.11_1539
```

In this example you can choose between 159.122.100.82, 159.122.100.91 and 158.177.255.212, as the node port is exposed on all three worker nodes.

So finally e.g. `159.122.100.82:30879` should return an nginx welcome screen.

### Validating pod-to-service access from jedi pod to yoda-svc

To validate the communication from jedi pod to yoda-svc we will use a bash shell within a jedi pod to try to reach the
statically namespaced DNS name of the yoda-svc. Remember **servicename.namespace.svc.cluster.local** can be leveraged.

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jedi-deployment-6fbb7bf48c-gbdnz   1/1     Running   0          28m
jedi-deployment-6fbb7bf48c-tr8wk   1/1     Running   0          28m
yoda-deployment-79bb79465d-6htpn   1/1     Running   0          27m
yoda-deployment-79bb79465d-fp92x   1/1     Running   0          27m

$ oc exec -t -i jedi-deployment-6fbb7bf48c-gbdnz bash
I have no name!@jedi-deployment-6fbb7bf48c-gbdnz:/app$

jedi-deployment-6fbb7bf48c-gbdnz:/app$ curl yoda-svc.dev-gw.svc.cluster.local

### Optional Activity - Create a route

Create a route for the jedi-svc.

```bash
$ oc expose svc jedi-svc
route.route.openshift.io/jedi-svc exposed
```

Get the URL for the route and use curl or your web browser to validate it.

```bash
$ oc get route
```
